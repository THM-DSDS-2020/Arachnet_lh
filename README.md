# Arachnet


## General Information

Arachnet is a tool which should give the user an overview of 
what is loaded in the background by the browser (only for Firefox). 
A lot of scripts, pictures or even fonts are loaded, some of which are only 
there to keep track of you. <br>
The current state of the add-on shows the number of found third-party 
domains and a list of the URLs called, as well as their types (script, image, font, etc.).
